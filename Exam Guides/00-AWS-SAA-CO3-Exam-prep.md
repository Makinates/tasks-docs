**# STUDY GUIDES**

##### Get Udemy Course by StÃ©phane Maarek for in-depth and easy-to-follow tutorials. 

**Jon Bonso & TutorialsDojos for their detailed practice exams and study guides. For anyone preparing for any AWS Solutions Architect certification, these resources are a must-have!
**

> **ExamTopics were also used for 2 weeks on a daily revision into the exam, went through all the Solution Architect tutorials on ExamTopics just to refresh on each of the services again for 7 days and spent few hours on reviewing the practice questions on Examtopics.**

**I will rather suggest to Focus more on Jon Bonso & TutorialsDojos practice exams on udemy, they have similar questions to the real exam and this help to broaden my understanding of the aws services. 

Keeping notes of the wrong answers in the practice exam and reading through them again help me to remember and understand them while I take the practice exams again.

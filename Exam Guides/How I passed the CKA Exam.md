# How I passed the CKA exam

*by Daniel Osarokutamwen*

The Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification is a globally recognized and highly sought-after credential for professionals working with Kubernetes, the leading open-source container orchestration platform. Kubernetes has become an essential tool for organizations seeking to streamline their application deployment, scaling, and management processes, enabling efficient and reliable operations in modern cloud-native environments.

## Prerequisites and Background

Before embarking on my journey to obtain the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification, I had already accumulated a solid foundation in linux administration, and containerization and orchestration technologies. My exposure to Docker, the industry-leading containerization technology, provided me with a strong understanding of the principles and benefits of containerizing applications.

In addition to my Docker experience, I had also gained familiarity with cloud platforms and their container orchestration services. Working with services like AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and Elastic Container Service (ECS) introduced me to the concept of managed Kubernetes clusters and the benefits they offer in terms of simplified deployment and maintenance.

It's worth mentioning that prior to embarking on my CKA journey, I had already prepared myself for the Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) certification. This provided me with a solid foundation in Kubernetes concepts, including pods, deployments, services, and storage management.

From April 1 to July 9, 2023, I participated in a #100DaysOfKubernetes challenge organized by my friend, mentor and co-organizer of CNCF Lagos Chapter, CNCF Ambassador [Ileriayo Adebiyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ileriayoadebiyi/). This challenge was my baptism into the world of Kubernetes. Everyday, for 100 days we learnt something new about Kubernetes as a community. We went throught the book [Kubernetes: Up and Running](https://a.co/d/7aeNGhT) by Kelsey Hightower, Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, and Lachlan Evenson.

## Study Resources

To prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam, I leveraged a combination of selected study resources, each offering a unique perspective and approach to mastering Kubernetes administration.

I also took the Ultimate CKA Mock Exams course on the KodeKloud platform. This resource features 13 comprehensive mock exams that closely resemble the format and difficulty level of the actual CKA exam. These mock exams proved invaluable in testing my knowledge and identifying any gaps or areas where I needed further improvement.

The mock exams challenge my problem-solving skills and ability to apply Kubernetes concepts in real-world scenarios. They covered all the necessary topics, including cluster architecture, installation and configuration, workload management, networking, storage, security, and troubleshooting.

After each mock exam session, I received detailed feedback and explanations, which helped me understand the rationale behind the correct answers and learn from my mistakes. This iterative process of taking mock exams, reviewing feedback, and reinforcing my knowledge proved to be an effective strategy in preparing for the CKA exam.

### James Spurin's "[DiveInto Kubernetes and Cloud-Native](https://diveinto.com/courses/dive-into-cloud-native-containers-kubernetes-and-the-kcna)" Course

While the KodeKloud courses provided a comprehensive overview of Kubernetes administration, worth mentioning is James Spurin's "DiveInto Kubernetes and Cloud-Native" course. This course, which I had taken months prior, provided a solid foundation in the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes and Cloud-Native technologies.

This course gave me an in-depth understanding of Kubernetes architecture, container runtime, networking, and storage components. It provided a strong theoretical grounding, which complemented the practical aspects covered in the other resources. Spurin's clear and concise explanations, coupled with real-world examples, helped me develop a deeper understanding of the underlying principles driving Kubernetes.

Equally important was the downloadable hands-on labs environment that was included in the course. This is now a highly valuable tool in my toolbox, as I use it at any point I need to test out something an need to quickly spin up a local multi-node Kubernetes environment.

### [Killer Shell's CKA Exam Simulator](https://killer.sh/)

As the exam date approached, I recognized the importance of practicing in an environment that closely mimicked the actual CKA exam setup. This is where Killer Shell's CKA Exam Simulator became an invaluable resource. When you purchase the CKA exam voucher, you also get two vouchers for Killer Shell. When you activate a session on Killer Shell, it lasts for 36 hours, giving you ample time to practice and learn from your mistakes as detailed solutions to each question is provided after the simulation.

The simulator provided a realistic and timed exam environment, complete with a Kubernetes cluster and a set of challenging questions and tasks. It allowed me to experience the pressure of working within a time constraint, managing multiple terminals, and navigating through various Kubernetes components and configurations.

The simulator's questions were diverse and covered a wide range of topics, testing my ability to apply my knowledge in practical scenarios. Additionally, the detailed explanations and solutions provided after each question helped me reinforce my understanding and learn from any mistakes or oversights.

By combining these study resources, I was able to approach the CKA exam with confidence, having gained a well-rounded perspective on Kubernetes administration. The hands-on practice, mock exams, and theoretical foundations provided by these resources were instrumental in my successful preparation for the challenging CKA certification.

## Study Plan, Strategies, and Exam Preparation

As the exam date approached, my focus shifted toward intensive practice and fine-tuning my skills to perform optimally on the big day. To begin with, I created a detailed timetable that allocated specific days and times for learning and practicing different topics covered in the CKA curriculum. This structured approach helped me maintain a steady pace and ensured that I covered all the essential areas without overlooking any critical concepts.

Each day, I dedicated time to studying theoretical concepts using the various resources at my disposal, such as video lectures, online documentation, and study guides. After solidifying the theoretical foundations, I immediately applied the knowledge through hands-on practice labs and exercises. This combination of theory and practice not only reinforced my understanding but also helped me develop muscle memory for executing Kubernetes commands and configurations.

Throughout my study journey, I maintained a comprehensive note in my [Obsidian Notetaking App](https://obsidian.md) where I documented important concepts, commands, and best practices. This notes app served as a valuable reference material, particularly for commands I didn't want to forget, allowing me to quickly revisit key points during my revision sessions.

The mock exams provided by resources like KodeKloud's Ultimate CKA Mock Exams course and Killer Shell's CKA Exam Simulator were instrumental in this final preparation phase.

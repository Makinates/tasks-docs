# Makinates Onboarding Document for New DevOps/Cloud Engineering Interns

Welcome to the Makinates DevOps/Cloud Engineering Internship programme! This document is designed to guide you through the onboarding process, providing instructions for installing essential tools, recommending helpful applications, and familiarizing you with our workflows and best practices.

## Project Management and Communication Tools

### ClickUp

ClickUp is our primary task/project management and collaboration tool. It allows us to organize tasks, track progress, and collaborate effectively as a team. You will receive an invitation to join our ClickUp workspace shortly after your onboarding process begins.

### Slack

Slack is our chosen platform for team communication. You will be added to the relevant channels, where you can engage in discussions, ask questions, and stay updated on important announcements. Slack is crucial for maintaining open lines of communication within our team.

## Daily Standup and Sprint Planning

We conduct daily standups at 1:30 PM (WAT) to synchronize our efforts and address any blockers or challenges. Additionally, we hold weekly sprint planning sessions every Saturday at 4:00 PM (WAT) to plan and prioritize tasks for the upcoming week.

## Documentation Requirement

In Makinates, documentation is a critical aspect of our workflow. Every task must be documented for it to be considered complete. This practice ensures knowledge transfer, facilitates onboarding of new team members, and maintains a comprehensive reference for future reference.
